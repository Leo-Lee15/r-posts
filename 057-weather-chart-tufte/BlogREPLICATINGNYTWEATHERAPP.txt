So much time since my last post, so I decided  to post something, no matter what it is, but I hope this will be somehow helpful.
In this post, I will show some new features for the next version of Highcharter package. The main feature added is hc_add_series, now it is a generic function! This mean you can add the data argument as numeric, data frame, time series (ts, xts, ohlc) among others, this way the syntaxe is much cleaner.
What we’ll do here? We’ll make an interactive version of the well-well-know-and-a-little-repeated Tufte weather chart.


  

There are good ggplot versions if you can start https://rpubs.com/tyshynsk/133318 andhttps://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/weather_graphic.
But our focus will be replicate the New York Time App: How Much Warmer Was Your City in 2015? Where you can choose among over 3K cities!. So let’s start. So we need an interactive charting library and shiny.
DATA
If you search/explore in the devTools in the previous link, you can know where is the path of the used data. So to be clear:
All the data used in this post is from http://www.nytimes.com – Me.
We’ll load the tidy verse, download the data, and create an auxiliar variable dt to store the date time in numeric format.
  

SETUP
Due the data is ready we’ll start to create the chart (a Highchart object):

No data to display. All according to the plan XD.
TEMPERATURE DATA
We’ll select the temperature columns from the data and do some wrangling, gather, spread, separate and recodes to get a nice tidy data frame.
  

  

Now, we can add this data to the highchart object using hc_add_series:

A really similar chart of what we want!
The original chart shows records of temperature. So we need to filter the days with temperature records using the columnstemp_rec_high and temp_rec_low, then some gathers and tweaks. Then set some options to show the points, like use fill color and some longer radius.

We’re good.
PRECIPITATION DATA
A nice feature of the NYTs app is and the chart is show the precipitation by month. This data is in another axis. So we need to create a list with two axes using the create_yaxis helper and then  to add those axes to the chart.


  

Manually add titles (I know this can be more elegant) and options.

The two axes are ready, now we need to add the data. We will add 12 series -one for each month- but we want to associate one legend for all these 12 series, so we need to use id and linkedTo parameters and obviously. That’s why the id will be a 'p' for the first element and then NA to the other 11 elements and then linked those 11 elements to the first series (id = 'p').
  

The same way we’ll add the normal precipitations by month.
  

VOLIA
Curious how the chart looks? Me too! Nah, I saw the chart before this post.

With R you can create a press style chart with some wrangling and charting. Now with a little of love we can make the code reusable to make a shiny app.
  

HOMEWORK


I will be grateful if someone will set grid lines for two axes as the original app, feel free to share the code.
See you :B!
